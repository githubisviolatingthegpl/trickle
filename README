trickle / trtty

Slow pipe and terminal.

TRICKLE is used as part of a shell pipeline and had very low throughput,
hence the name: data trickles through the pipe. By default, it passes on 600
bits per second, but this can be configured with the -b flag.

Usage:

  trickle [-b bitrate] <file
    or
  ... | trickle [-b bitrate]

Examples:

  $ trickle <README
     ...
  $ ls | trickle -b2600
     ...
  $ ls | trickle -b57.7k
     ...

The format for the -b (for 'baud') option is a number in range 50-57600. A
decimal separator and 'k' suffix can be used as per the example above.

TRTTY ('trickle tty') might be the more interesting version of this tool: it
spawns an interactive subterminal with very low throughput. It simulates the
experience of using a terminal over a slow serial connection.

Usage:

  trtty [-b bitrate] [command ...]

Examples:
 
  $ trtty -b14.4k elinks news.ycombinator.com
  
  $ trtty -b2600 bash  # now in the trtty session
  $ man man
     ...
  $ exit
  exit
  $                    # back to regular terminal

The command argument can be ommitted, in which case the default shell $SHELL
will be used, or /bin/sh if $SHELL is not defined.

Compatibility: tested on FreeBSD, macOS, Linux and Linux with musl.

Building: after tweaking the Makefile if desired,

  make
