TRICKLE

trickle is used as part of a shell pipeline and had very low throughput,
hence the name: data trickles through the pipe. By default, it passes on 600
bits per second, but this can be configured with the -b flag.

Usage:

  trickle [-b bitrate] <file
    or
  ... | trickle [-b bitrate]

Examples:

  $ trickle <README
     ...
  $ ls | trickle -b2600
     ...
  $ ls | trickle -b57.7k
     ...

The format for the -b (for 'baud') option is a number in range 50-57600. A
decimal separator and 'k' suffix can be used as per the example above.


TRITTY

tritty ('trickle tty') might be the more interesting version of this tool: it
spawns an interactive subterminal with very low throughput. It simulates the
experience of using a terminal over a slow connection.

Usage:

  tritty [-b bitrate] [command ...]

Examples:
 
  $ tritty -b14.4k elinks news.ycombinator.com
  
  $ tritty -b2600 bash  # now in the tritty session
  $ man man
     ...
  $ exit
  exit
  $                     # back to regular terminal

The command argument can be ommitted, in which case the default shell $SHELL
will be used, or /bin/sh if $SHELL is not defined.

Note that by only limiting throughput tritty does not accurately simulate the
experience of using a serial device. In particular, it does not set the baud
rate on the virtual terminal which software might use to adjust their output.

Use stty from within a tritty session to adjust the boud rate attribute of the
terminal, for example:

  $ tritty -b2600
  $ stty 2600

tritty will restore the original settings on exit.


BUILDING

Should work on most Unix-like systems, perhaps with some tweaks. Tested on
FreeBSD, macOS, Linux and Linux with musl.

After tweaking the Makefile if desired:

  make
